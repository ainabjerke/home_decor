# Home Decor
In this design project we were tasked with coming up with a design for a Home Decor website with HTML and CSS.
The following requirements were to be followed:
- Create a simple logo for the website and include in the homepage.
- Include basic content, i.e. heading, a few navigation links, a couple content areas, and Latin text for content areas     if needed.
- Choose a colour scheme and with 2-3 colors to combine for use in the website which goes with the brand, i.e. logo of     the website, use in backgrounds of elements/content areas and or elements on the page.
- Find online/choose or create and use a seamless textures/pattern for use in the background of the website.
- Choose 2-3 fonts for the Home Decor website homepage and products page: Research and find good pairings of fonts for:
  - the headings
  - the body text
  - and a third font for calls to actions.
- Code these fonts into the existing products page for the headings, subheadings and body text, and style with CSS and     use relevant heading text, i.e. replace your Latin text from the ast assignment with text content.
